* An Org-mode buffer management tool

The function `org-buffers-list' creates a read-only Org-mode buffer
populated with links to currently open buffers. By default, buffers
are grouped by major mode. Buffers can be flagged for deletion (d) and
pending operations executed (x), in a similar way to dired and
buffer-menu-mode.

* Tasks [5/7]
*** STARTED Operations on buffers [2/4]
    These work by setting tags to define pending operations, and then
    executing those operations.
***** TODO o
***** TODO save buffer
***** UI: follow dired or buffer-menu-mode?
***** Implement other actions of dired or buffer-menu-mode?
***** DONE u
***** DONE kill buffer
*** STARTED Filtering, folding and sorting
***** TODO Add modes which should be folded by default
***** TODO Buffer-name blacklist for filtering
***** TODO Major mode blacklist for filtering
***** Sort by recency?
***** When grouping by file/dir, use directory hierarchy?
***** Store further buffer properties
      - buffer-modified-p
      - buffer size
      - buffer minor modes
*** DONE Use stripped down mapping function
*** Message when following link to visible buffer
    and hence doing nothing
*** Extend to files?
    - recent files?
*** Organise by frames
*** Deal with acting on region more correctly
    I.e. Is it right that d is for this line whereas D is for region?
*** DONE Set meaningful tags as buffer-local variable
    To be offered as tag completions
*** DONE Add hook
    E.g. to
    - replace the terminal -mode on major mode names
    - filter buffers / major modes
*** DONE Make RET work elsewhere on header line to follow link?
    Could do this with a speed command.
*** DONE Macro for working with params?
* Bugs [4/6]
*** Tags can be hard to line up with buffers
*** DONE Tags for deletion [3/3]
***** DONE Deletes alternates
***** DONE Needs active region
***** DONE Executing pending doesn't work first time
*** TODO Ungrouped mode
*** DONE Stop hijacking keys in other org buffers
*** DONE Make tags visible
*** CANCELLED Get rid of newline at eob 
*** TODO Point movement
