* An Org-mode buffer management tool

The function `org-buffers-list' creates a read-only Org-mode buffer
populated with links to currently open buffers. By default, buffers
are grouped by major mode. Buffers can be flagged for deletion (d) and
pending operations executed (x), in a similar way to dired and
buffer-menu-mode.

* Tasks [5/8]
*** TODO Clean out unused code / undesired functionality
    Get rid of insert-as-list-item?
*** Implement list ansd clean view using regexp substitution
*** STARTED Operations on buffers [3/3]
    These work by setting tags to define pending operations, and then
    executing those operations.
***** Show buffer-modified
***** Save buffer
***** Show buffer read-only
***** Link following behaviour
      The philosophy is that RET should do what org would do on a link; this
      concern overrides the fact that dired and Buffer-menu-mode use switch
      to buffer in current window on RET. Instead we use, currently, '.' for
      current window. Like dired and Buffer-menu-mode we use 'o' for other
      window (which may well have the same effect as RET).

***** Implement other actions of dired or buffer-menu-mode?
***** DONE o
***** DONE u
***** DONE kill buffer
*** STARTED Filtering, folding and sorting
***** TODO Add modes which should be folded by default
***** TODO Buffer-name blacklist for filtering
***** TODO Major mode blacklist for filtering
***** Sort by recency?
***** When grouping by file/dir, use directory hierarchy?
***** Store further buffer properties
      - buffer-modified-p
      - buffer size
      - buffer minor modes
*** DONE Use stripped down mapping function
*** Message when following link to visible buffer
    and hence doing nothing
*** Extend to files?
    - recent files?
*** Organise by frames
*** Deal with acting on region more correctly
    I.e. Is it right that d is for this line whereas D is for region?
*** Is (s-e (b-o-l) (outline-level)) idiomatic?
*** DONE Set meaningful tags as buffer-local variable
    To be offered as tag completions
*** DONE Add hook
    E.g. to
    - replace the terminal -mode on major mode names
    - filter buffers / major modes
*** DONE Make RET work elsewhere on header line to follow link?
    Could do this with a speed command.
*** DONE Macro for working with params?
* Bugs [12/16]
*** Don't use props for b-m-p? just tags
*** TODO Grouping by property that can be nil screws up
*** Should get rid of properties when moving to lines mode?
*** No such buffer nil on RET to deleted
    This error message from org-open-at-point
*** Compare details of region selection with other modes
*** How to check for current minor modes?
    Ratheer than testing buffer name
*** TODO Ungrouped mode
*** DONE Point movement when properties
*** CANCELLED Stop buffer links over-riding file links
    and yet make them usable.
    I've set them not to store on org-store-link
*** CANCELLED Add context to buffer links
    Can use [[file:/usr/local/src/emacs/org-mode-core/lisp/org.el::org%20make%20org%20heading%20search%20string%20txt][this]] for org buffers. I'm leaving this for now.
*** DONE D in line mode sets on first of region only
*** DONE d on single line causes previous one to get tag also
*** DONE %20 in buffer name
*** DONE Deleting last 4 caused text screw up
*** DONE Tags can be hard to line up with buffers
*** DONE Tags for deletion [3/3]
***** DONE Deletes alternates
***** DONE Needs active region
***** DONE Executing pending doesn't work first time
*** DONE Stop hijacking keys in other org buffers
*** DONE Make tags visible
*** CANCELLED Get rid of newline at eob
