* Org-buffers

This provides a function org-buffers-list-buffers, which creates an
Org-mode buffer listing. Buffers are grouped by major mode; within
each major-mode, the heading for each buffer is a link to the buffer.

The file also provides links to buffers for org-mode.

* Tasks
*** TODO Set meaningful tags as buffer-local variable
    To be offered as tag completions
*** STARTED Operations on buffers
    These could work by setting tags to define pending operations,
    and then executing those operations.
***** TODO Implement some of the operations of Buffer-menu-mode
******* TODO o
***** TODO save buffer
***** DONE kill buffer
*** STARTED Filtering,folding and sorting 
***** TODO Add modes which should be folded by default
***** TODO Buffer-name blacklist for filtering
***** TODO Major mode blacklist for filtering
***** DONE buffer names
***** Sort by recency?
***** When grouping by file/dir, use directory hierarchy?
***** Store further buffer properties
      - buffer-modified-p
      - buffer size
      - buffer minor modes
*** Extend to recent files?
*** Organise by frames
*** DONE Add hook
    E.g. to
    - replace the terminal -mode on major mode names
    - filter buffers / major modes
*** DONE Make RET work elsewhere on header line to follow link?
    Could do this with a speed command.
*** DONE Macro for working with params?
* Bugs
*** TODO Ungrouped mode
*** DONE Tags for deletion
*** DONE Stop hijacking keys in other org buffers
*** DONE Make tags visible
*** CANCELLED Get rid of newline at eob 
*** TODO Point movement
