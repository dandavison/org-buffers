* Org-buffers

This provides a function org-buffers-list-buffers, which creates an
Org-mode buffer listing. Buffers are grouped by major mode; within
each major-mode, the heading for each buffer is a link to the buffer.

The file also provides links to buffers for org-mode.

Possible extensions

*** Operations on buffers
    - save buffer
    - kill buffer
*** Further buffer info for sorting, etc
    Information for each buffer is stored as properties of the
    buffer's entry in the listing. At the moment the only property
    stored is major-mode, but we could add further info which may be
    useful for sorting and reviewing buffers. E.g.
    - buffer-modified-p
    - buffer size
    - buffer minor modes
